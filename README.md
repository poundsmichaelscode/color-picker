# CSS3 Animations and JavaScript User Preferences

This project demonstrates a simple interactive web page that uses **CSS3 animations** and **JavaScript functions** to enhance user experience. Users can select their preferred button color using a color picker, and their choice is saved using `localStorage`. The button features a bounce animation on hover and click.

## 🧩 Features

- 🎨 Customizable button color using a native color picker
- 💾 Persistent user preferences using `localStorage`
- 🪄 Smooth bounce animation using CSS3 `@keyframes`
- 🔁 Real-time UI updates based on user input

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User selects a color** from the color picker.
2. The selected color is saved in `localStorage`.
3. When the page is reloaded, the button retains the chosen color.
4. Clicking the button triggers a visual animation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — Structure of the webpage
- **CSS3** — Styling and bounce animations
- **JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage
